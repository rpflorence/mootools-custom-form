CustomForm
==========

Create custom designed, accessible form elements.

Borrowed graphics from [Uniform](https://github.com/pixelmatrix/uniform) (great job, btw) but nothing more.

IE6 not supported.

Building
--------

You should build MooTools modules w/ Packager.  Included in the repo is a build script with enough to get the demos to work.

	$ ./build
